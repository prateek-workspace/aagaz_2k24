        Hobbies are practised for interest and enjoyment, rather than financial reward. Engaging in a hobby can lead to acquiring substantial skills, knowledge, and experience. However, personal fulfilment is the aim.

        So, HBTU introduced a hobby sub-council that not only instructs children on how to be creative but also to apply that creativity in life.
        <br></br>
         What are hobbies for some people are professions for others. Generally speaking, the person who does something for fun, not remuneration, is called an amateur (or hobbyist), as distinct from a professional.
